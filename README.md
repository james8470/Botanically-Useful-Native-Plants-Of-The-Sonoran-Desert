Botanically Useful Native Plants of the Sonoran Desert [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6944744.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6916947)
===================== 
This is a datasheet containing information for over 500 botanically useful plants (edible and/or medicinal) native to the Sonoran Desert. Intended for scientific study and general use. This datasheet describes what the plants may be used for, which parts of the plants may be used, and which indigenous groups have been documented to use them. This datasheet is not intended as a usage guide, some plants may be toxic unless properly prepared.

## Descriptions of Variables 

"Lifecycle" - If the plant typically completes its lifecycle in one year ("Annual"), two years ("Biannual"), or over multiple years ("Perennial")

"Growthhabit" - What the general growth habit of the plant is ("Herb","Shrub","Vine","Epiphyte","Tree","Succulent","Grass")

"Reproduction" - Describes how the plant reproduces (angiosperms are separated as "Monocot" and "Dicot")

"ICUNStatus" - How the species is classified under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species

"Riparian" - If the plant is found in riparian areas

"Coastal" - If the plant is found in coastal areas

"LCRV" - If the plant is found within the Lower Colorado River Valley region of the Sonoran Desert

"AU" - If the plant is found within the Arizona Upland region of the Sonoran Desert

"POS" - If the plant is found within the Plains of Sonora region of the Sonoran Desert

"CGC" - If the plant is found within the Central Gulf Coast region of the Sonoran Desert

"V" - If the plant is found within the Vizcaino region of the Sonoran Desert

"M" - If the plant is found within the Magdalena region of the Sonoran Desert

*Remaining columns describe the edible or medicinal sections of the plants, what the plant may be used for medicinally (if applicable), and which indigenous groups have been documented to use them.
